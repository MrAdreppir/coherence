# Coherence
Computational and Formal Modeling assignment 2: coherence as constraint satisfaction

## Matlab settings
run `controlpanel` to startup the control panel. Change the parameters according to the slides.

This program generates a random network from the settings the users provides in the `controlpanel`.
You have to manually add the special node _S_ to the variables generated by the panel.
- Initial activation of _S_ must be 1. 
- All the edges towards _S_ needs to have a weight of 0.5. 
- All other edges have to be -0.6 (inhibition) or 0.4 (excitation).
